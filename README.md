This application is a problem bank application. It is mainly used to create problems that can be stored, and retrived later for testing and examination purpose. It can also be used to review materials.

This program can 
- Store, sort, and classify entered problems and answers. 
- Retrieve these problems for edit or testing. 
- Create exams which select creates a random subset from the set of all problems according to certain criterias. 
- Each exam can have their own logs tracking the progress of the user 

Its targeted users are primarily
- Students
- Teachers making review materials
- Exam creators

This project is of interest to me because I am a student who felt the lack of organized materials back in highschool. It is up to the teacher's discretion to give practice materials and notes.
There are also great online sources to practice, but there lacked a _systematic approach to sort, pick, and organize problems_. The overall organization of course conetent and material is already much better now that I am in university. However, I think this is a good chance to create a mini-tool for organizing problems that I can at least use for myself.
